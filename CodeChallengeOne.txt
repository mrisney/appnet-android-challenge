/*  CODE CHALLENGE - One
App.net is an aggregator of messaging sites.  Build a viewer app for the global/public posts.

Uri = "https://alpha-api.app.net/stream/0/posts/stream/global"

Posts should be rendered in a vertical list, sorted by time, with the most recent at the top of the list and oldest at the bottom
Need to control the maximum number of items in the list (based on either count or only what has arrived in the last N minutes)
Each row should contain the user’s avatar
Each row should contain the poster’s name in bold (and add a subtle color)
Each row should contain the post text, and be variable height, depending on the text size
New posts are added to the top of the list on a regular basis
Top of the list is always displayed by default
The list should scroll smoothly and quickly (flick up/down)
Button to "pause" the list for reading (turn off auto-scrolling)
App should run over night without stopping/crashing

 Engineering Requirements:
 - Android Studio project
 - access App.net using Retrofit and RxJava
 - GSON annotations
 - latest Material Design
 - we want to see some lambdas, using either RetroLambda or Android "N"
 - Android "N" would be cool, but not necessary
